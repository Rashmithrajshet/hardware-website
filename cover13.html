        <h1> what is FAN</h1><br>
        <p class="para">
            A fan is a hardware device that keeps the overall computer or a computer device cool by circulating air to or from the computer or component. The picture is an example of a fan on a heat sink.

The speed of a fan is measured in revolutions per minute or RPM, and the higher the RPM rating, the faster the fan spins. However, in many cases, the higher the RPM rating, the louder a fan.</p><br>
 
<h1>Types of fans found in a computer</h1><br>

<p class="para">
    
Below is a listing of the different types of fans inside a computer, and the computer hardware components that require fans to function correctly.<br>

<b>Case fan</b> - a fan on the side of a computer case, inside the case. It helps circulate air in the computer case and blow hotter air out of the case.<br>
<b>CPU fan</b> - a fan on top of a computer processor. It helps pull and blow hot air off the processor, helping keep it cooler.<br>
<b>Power supply fan</b> - a fan located inside a power supply. The power supply fan blows hotter air out of the power supply and out of the computer.<br>
<b>Video card fan</b> - a fan on a video card. It helps keep more powerful video cards from overheating, especially when playing video games, editing videos, and other GPU or graphic-intensive tasks.<br></p>

<h1>What if a computer has no fans or the fans stop working</h1><br>

<p class="para">
    Unless designed to work without fans, a computer with no fans or bad fans can cause one or more component to overheat. When a component overheats, it can cause physical damage. To help prevent damage, most of today's hardware automatically turn off or restart to help prevent the damage.</p><br>

<h1>How many fans are in a computer?</h1><br>

<p class="para">
    
With computers and fans, there is no standard to how many fans may be in the computer. Most desktop computers often have at least four fans (one case fan, CPU heat sink fan, power supply fan, and video card fan). It is also not uncommon for computers to have an additional front case fan to help with the airflow. However, a desktop computer can also have no fans if it uses liquid cooling.
