        <h1> what is NVMe </h1><br>
        <p class="para">NVMe stands for Non Volatile Memory Express<br>
            NVMe technology provides superior storage, superior speed and superior compatibility. Since NVMe utilises PCIe sockets, it transfers 25x more data than the SATA equivalent. 
            Along with more data, NVMe’s commands are 2x faster than that of AHCI drivers.<br> In addition, NVMe input/output operations per second (IOPS) exceeds 1 million and is up to 900% faster compared to AHCI drives. 
            NVMe also communicates directly with the system CPU, 
            giving it incredible speeds due to its compatibility. NVMe drives work with all major operating systems regardless of form factor.

            NVME LogoNVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a communications interface and driver that takes advantage of the increased bandwidth PCIe has to offer. 
            It’s designed to increase performance and efficiency while making a broad range of enterprise and client systems interoperable. 
            NVMe was designed for SSDs and communicates between the storage interface and the system’s CPU using high-speed PCIe sockets without the limitations of form factor.
            
            The NVMe protocol utilises parallel, low-latency data paths to the underlying media, like high-performance processor architectures. 
            This offers significantly higher performance and lower latencies compared to SAS and SATA protocols. 
            NVMe can support multiple I/O queues, up to 64K with each queue having 64K entries. 
            This allows input/output tasks to transfer more data faster than older storage models using legacy drivers such as AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface). 
            Since NVMe is designed specifically for SSDs, it will eventually become the new industry standard.</p>
           <h1> How does NVMe work?</h1><br> 
            <p class="para">
                
The NVMe standard does not state NVMe's main use; however, it does define a register interface, command set and collection of features for PCIe-based SSDs with the goals of high performance and interoperability across a broad range of NVM systems.

The NVMe protocol can support any form of non-volatile memory, such as SSDs that use different types of non-volatile memory, including NAND flash. NVMe reference drivers are available for a variety of operating systems, including Windows and Linux.

An NVMe SSD connects through a PCIe bus or M.2 and U.2 connectors. The NVMe protocol, attached with these connections, enables lower latency and higher IOPS along with a reduction in power use.

NVMe commands map input/output (I/O) and responses to shared memory in a host computer over a PCIe interface. The NVMe interface supports parallel I/O with multicore processors to facilitate high throughput and address central processing unit (CPU) bottlenecks.

 <h1>Why is NVMe important?</h1><br>           
<p class="para"> 
    Designed for high-performance non-volatile storage media such as SSDs, NVMe is well-suited for highly demanding, compute-intensive settings. For example, NVMe can handle enterprise workloads while leaving a smaller infrastructure footprint and consuming less power.
    
    By comparison, there is a large performance difference between NVMe and SATA. For example, NVMe experiences much less latency than SAS and SATA protocols. This increase in performance and reduced latency means that NVMe can be used with workload-intensive applications that need real-time processing while avoiding bottlenecks.
    
    Enterprise environments and data centers can take advantage of the high-performance granted by NVMe-based storage.</p>
     
    <h1>What are NVMe's use cases?</h1><br>
    <p class="para">
    Because of the blistering performance for flash storage NVMe provides, along with its ability to handle a high number of queues and commands, NVMe is suitable for:<br>
    
    Professional and prosumer use, handling tasks such as graphics editing.<br>
    Applications with large queue depths for storage I/O, including databases and some web operations.<br>
    High-performance computing. Specifically, in applications where low latency is critical.<br>
    Areas that require the storage of large amounts of data, such as in AI, machine learning, advanced analytics and big data.<br>
    Relational databases. The better performance of NVMe flash memory systems lowers the number of physical servers needed.<br>
    Applications that need to retrieve or store data in real time, such as finance and e-commerce apps.</p>
 
    <h1>What are the benefits of NVMe?</h1><br>

    <p class="para">
        NVMe drives can send commands twice as fast compared to AHCI SATA drives.<br>
        NVMe SSDs have a latency of only a few microseconds, while SATA SSDs have latency between 30 and 100 microseconds.<br>
        Efficient storage, management and data access.<br>
        Has a much higher bandwidth compared to SATA and SAS.<br>
        Supports multiple form factors, including M.2, U.2 and connections.<br>
        Data can be divided and streamlined.<br>
        Supports tunneling protocols, which address privacy.</p>

    <h1>What are the drawbacks of NVMe?</h1><br>
        
        <p class="para">
A lack of support for NVMe on legacy systems.</br>
Not cost-effective at storing large volumes of data. It is more expensive compared to spinning drives based on storage capacity.</br>
It is typically used with the M.2 format, which may further limit drive selection.</br>
