        <p class="para">
            Alternatively referred to as a desktop display, a display or display device is a term used to describe the device used to view video, images, or text. Any information shown on a display is sometimes referred to as a soft copy. 
            The picture is an example of a flat-panel display and the most common display used with computers today.

Anything capable of connecting to a computer and displaying its output is considered an output device. 
Below is a listing of the most commonly used display devices.<br>

1.CRT monitor<br>
2.Flat-panel display<br>
3.LCD (active-matrix, passive-matrix).<br>
4.Projector<br>
5.Touch screen<br>
6.TV (HDTV, Plasma TV, UHDTV, Smart TV).</p><br>

<h1>CRT</h1><br>
<p class="para">Short for cathode ray tube, a CRT is the electron beams in a monitor moving across your screen either interlaced or non-interlaced, hitting phosphor dots inside the glass tube. The picture is an example of the inside of a computer monitor that shows the CRT connected to the screen.

    In the CRT are three electron guns: red, green, and blue. Each of these guns streams a steady flow of electrons, left to right, for each line of your monitor. As the electrons hit the phosphors on the CRT, the phosphor will glow certain intensities. As a new line begins, the guns will then begin at the left and continue right. These guns will repeat this process sometimes thousands of times until the screen is completely drawn line by line.
    
    Once the phosphors on the CRT are hit with an electron, they only glow for a short time. Because of this, the CRT must be refreshed, which means the process will be repeated as explained above. If the video card's refresh rate is not set high enough, you may see flickers or a noticeable steady line scrolling from top to bottom of the screen.</p><br>

    <h1>Flat-panel dispaly</h1><br>
    <p class="para">
        Sometimes abbreviated as FPD, a flat-panel display is a display technology which succeeds CRT as the new standard for desktop computer displays. Unlike CRT monitors, flat-panel displays use LCD (liquid crystal display) or LED (light-emitting diode) screens, making them lighter and thinner.

The picture shows an example of an ASUS flat-panel display.

<h1>LCD</h1><br>
<p class="para">
    Short for liquid-crystal display, LCD is a flat display technology used in laptops, cell phones, calculators, digital cameras, and flat screen displays. The LCD is made of two sheets of a flexible polarizing material and a layer of liquid crystal solution between the two. An LCD is available as an active-matrix, dual-scan, or passive-matrix display and are most common with laptop computers, like the Dell laptop computer shown in the picture.

An LCD does not refresh like a CRT monitor. Instead, a picture is created by sending electricity through liquid crystals which untwist at the rate of electricity applied, creating 64 shades.

<h1>Touch screen</h1><br>

<p class="para">
    A touch screen is a display device that allows users to interact with a computer using their finger or stylus. They're a useful alternative to a mouse or keyboard for navigating a GUI (graphical user interface). Touch screens are used on various devices, such as computer and laptop displays, smartphones, tablets, cash registers, and information kiosks. Some touch screens use a grid of infrared beams to sense the presence of a finger instead of utilizing touch-sensitive input.</p><br>

    <h1>TV (HDTV, Plasma TV, UHDTV, Smart TV)</h1><br>
    <p class="para">
        Short for television, a TV or telly is an electronics device that receives a visual and audio signal and plays it for the viewer. There is a debate over who is credited as being the inventor of the TV. The two candidates are Vladimir Zworykin, a Russian-born American who worked for Westinghouse, and Philo Taylor Farnsworth, a boy in Beaver City, Utah. Vladimir held the patent for the TV, but it was Farnsworth who was the first person to successfully transmit a TV signal on September 7, 1927. The picture shows the Panasonic TH-58PZ750U, an example of a television.
