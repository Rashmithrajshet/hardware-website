        <h1> what is Motherboard</h1><br>
        <p class="para">motherboard alternatively referred to as the
             mb, mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane board, base board, main circuit board, planar board, 
             system board, or a logic board on Apple computers. The motherboard is a printed circuit board and
              foundation of a computer that is the biggest board in a computer chassis.
               It allocates power and allows communication to and between
                the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components.<br>
                <h1>Motherboard overview</h1><br>
                <p class="para">A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, 
                like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. 
                There are multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different 
                types and sizes of computers.
Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory, 
so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However,
 hard drives are mostly universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand

Below is a picture of the ASUS P5AD2-E motherboard with labels next to each of its major components.

    <h1>Where is the motherboard located?</h1><br>
    <p class="para">A computer motherboard is located inside the computer case and is where most of the parts and computer peripherals connect.
 With tower computers, the motherboard is on the left or right side of the tower and is the biggest circuit board.<br></p>

        <h1>How many connections, ports, or slots are on a motherboard?</h1>
        <p class="para">  There's no set standard to how many connections, ports, or expansion slots are on a motherboard. The best method of determining how many connections, ports, or slots are available for your motherboard is to look up the specifications contained in its documentation. If you've lost or discarded your motherboard's documentation, you can often download a free PDF version from the manufacturer's website.</p>
    
    <h1>How to find the type of computer motherboard.</h1>
    <p class="para"> Why are the slots and connections different colors?
    The slots, ports, and connections on a motherboard may be color-coded to help identify the type of slot, port, or connector. For example, with our motherboard picture, the IDE connectors are different colors to help identify the primary and secondary connectors. When the memory slots are different colors, it indicates the memory slots are dual-channel, and pairs of memory should be installed on the same channel (color). For example, in our picture, the yellow memory slots are Channel A, and Channel B are the black slots. If you were only installing two memory sticks, you'd want to install both of them in Channel A (yellow slots) for optimal performance.</p><br>
