        <h1> what is Keyboard</h1><br>
        <p class="para">A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer. Similar to an electric typewriter, a keyboard is composed of buttons used to create letters, numbers, and symbols, and perform additional functions. The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to some of the frequently asked questions about the keyboard.</p><br>
        <h1>What are the keyboard rows?</h1>
            <p class="para">The horizontal rows of character keys in the typing area have specific names. For example, when placing your hands on the keyboard, they should be positioned over the home row keys. The keys below the home row are called the bottom row keys, and above the home row keys are the top row keys.</p><br>
            <h1>Types of keyboards</h1><br>
            <p class="para">Today, most keyboards are similar to each other but may be missing one or more of the sections mentioned earlier (e.g., the keypad). Where keyboards begin to differ the most is in their construction and design. Some keyboards are mechanical, while others use membrane keys. Some keyboards utilize a standard design, like the Saitek keyboard pictured above, and others are split down the middle, utilizing an ergonomic design. Some keyboards are rigid and always the same shape, while others are flexible and can fold in half or roll up.
                
                Most keyboards use the QWERTY layout, but there are still designs that utilize the DVORAK layout.</p><br>

            <h1>What else can a keyboard do?</h1>

            <p class="para">
                A computer keyboard has many more functions than typing. Below is a list of additional tasks you can perform using a keyboard.
                
                Enter commands in a command line or another CLI (command-line interface).<br>
                Use keyboard shortcuts to perform tasks quickly. For example<br> using Ctrl+C to copy text and Ctrl+V to paste it elsewhere.<br>
                Use the function keys to perform tasks. For example,<br> pressing F5 in a browser to refresh a web page.<br>
                Control computer hardware. For example, <br>many keyboards can change your speakers' volume.<br>
                Use the arrow keys to move the text cursor on the screen.<br>
                Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to move a character in a game.<br>
                Use the numeric keypad to make calculations in a calculator.</p> <br> 
                
                <h1>Laptop keyboards</h1><br>

                <p class="para">A laptop keyboard is arranged differently than a desktop keyboard to accommodate the laptop's narrower footprint. Most laptop keyboards are made smaller by placing the keys closer and by including an Fn key. The Fn key is used to give other keys more than once function. For example, pressing the Fn key and the up or down arrow on the keyboard may increase or decrease screen brightness (shown below). Also, many laptop keyboards generally omit the numeric keypad to save space.</p><br>
                 <h1>smartphones Keyboard</h1>
                <p class="para">Today's smartphones and tablets do not come with a physical keyboard, although one may be purchased as an optional peripheral add-on. These devices utilize a thumb keyboard or on-screen keyboard to type messages and enter text into various fields. The image is an example of the Apple iPhone on-screen keyboard, used on all Apple touch-based devices.</p><br>
