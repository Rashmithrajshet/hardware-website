        <h1> what is GPU</h1><br>
        <p class="para">Graphics processing technology has evolved to deliver unique benefits in the world of computing. The latest graphics processing units (GPUs) 
            unlock new possibilities in gaming, content creation, machine learning, and more.</p><br>

            <h1>What Does a GPU Do?</h1><br>
<p class="para">The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing. Designed for parallel processing, the GPU is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering. Although they’re best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).

GPUs were originally designed to accelerate the rendering of 3D graphics. Over time, they became more flexible and programmable, enhancing their capabilities. This allowed graphics programmers to create more interesting visual effects and realistic scenes with advanced lighting and shadowing techniques. Other developers also began to tap the power of GPUs to dramatically accelerate additional workloads in high performance computing (HPC), deep learning, and more.</p>\


<h1>GPU and CPU: Working Together</h1>
<p class="para">The GPU evolved as a complement to its close cousin, the CPU (central processing unit). While CPUs have continued to deliver performance increases through architectural innovations, faster clock speeds, and the addition of cores, GPUs are specifically designed to accelerate computer graphics workloads. When shopping for a system, it can be helpful to know the role of the CPU vs. GPU so you can make the most of both.</p>

<h1>GPU vs. Graphics Card: What’s the Difference?</h1>
<p class="para">While the terms GPU and graphics card (or video card) are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle distinction between these terms. Much like a motherboard contains a CPU, a graphics card refers to an add-in board that incorporates the GPU. This board also includes the raft of components required to both allow the GPU to function and connect to the rest of the system.

GPUs come in two basic types: integrated and discrete. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card at all and is instead embedded alongside the CPU. A discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own circuit board and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.</p><br>


<h1>Integrated Graphics Processing Unit</h1><br>

<p class="para">The majority of GPUs on the market are actually integrated graphics. So, what are integrated graphics and how does it work in your computer? A CPU that comes with a fully integrated GPU on its motherboard allows for thinner and lighter systems, reduced power consumption, and lower system costs.

Intel® Graphics Technology, which includes Intel® Arc™ and Intel® Iris® Xe graphics, is at the forefront of integrated graphics technology. With Intel® Graphics, users can experience immersive graphics in systems that run cooler and deliver long battery life.</p>

<h1>Discrete Graphics Processing Unit</h1><br>

<p class="para">Many computing applications can run well with integrated GPUs. However, for more resource-intensive applications with extensive performance demands, a discrete GPU (sometimes called a dedicated graphics card) is better suited to the job.

These GPUs add processing power at the cost of additional energy consumption and heat creation. Discrete GPUs generally require dedicated cooling for maximum performance.</p>
