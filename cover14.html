        <h1> what is Operating System</h1><br>
        <p class="para">
            An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user. Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs. Applications like Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games, etc., need some environment to run and perform its tasks.

The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer’s language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating system.</p>

<h1>History of OS</h1><br>

<p class="para">
1) Operating systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage<br>
2) The General Motors Research Lab implemented the first OS in the early 1950s for their IBM 701<br>
3) In the mid-1960s, operating systems started to use disks<br>
4) In the late 1960s, the first version of the Unix OS was developed<br>
5) The first OS built by Microsoft was DOS. It was built in 1981 by purchasing the 86-DOS software from a Seattle company<br>
6) The present-day popular OS Windows first came to existence in 1985 when a GUI was created and paired with MS-DOS.<br>

<h1>Types of Operating System (OS)</h1><br>

<p class="para">
Following are the popular types of OS (Operating System):<br>

1) Batch Operating System<br>
2) Multitasking/Time Sharing OS<br>
3) Multiprocessing OS<br>
4) Real Time OS<br>
5) Distributed OS<br>
6) Network OS<br>
7) Mobile OS<br>
</p><br>

<h1> Batch Operating System</h1><br>

<p class="para">
Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same process, a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.

The user of a batch operating system never directly interacts with the computer. In this type of OS, every user prepares his or her job on an offline device like a punch card and submit it to the computer operator.

Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems
Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing.</p>

<h1>Real time OS</h1><br>
<p class="para">A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems are the Real time OS example.</p>

<h1>Distributed Operating System</h1><br>
<p class="para">Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.</p>

<h1>Network Operating System</h1><br>
<p class="para">Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.</p>

<h1>Mobile OS</h1><br>
<p class="para">Mobile operating systems are those OS which is especially that are designed to power smartphones, tablets, and wearables devices.
Some most famous mobile operating systems are Android and iOS, but others include BlackBerry, Web, and watchOS.

<h1>Features of Operating System (OS)</h1><br>

<p class="para">
Here is a list important features of OS:<br>

1) Protected and supervisor mode<br>
2) Allows disk access and file systems Device drivers Networking Security<br>
3) Program Execution<br>
4) Memory management Virtual Memory Multitasking<br>
5) Handling I/O operations<br>
6) Manipulation of the file system<br>
7) Error Detection and handling<br>
8) Resource allocation<br>
9) Information and Resource Protection<br>

</p><br>

<h1>Advantage of OS</h1><br>

<p class="para">
1) Allows you to hide details of hardware by creating an abstraction<br>
2) Easy to use with a GUI<br>
3) Offers an environment in which a user may execute programs/applications<br>
4) The operating system must make sure that the computer system convenient to use<br>
5) Operating System acts as an intermediary among applications and the hardware components<br>
6) It provides the computer system resources with easy to use format<br>
7) Acts as an intermediator between all hardware’s and software’s of the system<br>
</p><br>

<h1>Disadvantages of Operating System</h1><br>

<p class="para">
    1) If any issue occurs in OS, you may lose all the contents which have been stored in your system<br>
    2) Operating system’s software is quite expensive for small size organization which adds burden on them. Example Windows<br>
    3) It is never entirely secure as a threat can occur at any time<br>
