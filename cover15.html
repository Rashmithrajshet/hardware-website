        <p class="para">
            A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI (graphical user interface) for pointing, moving and selecting text, icons, files, and folders on your computer. In addition to these functions, a mouse can also be used to drag-and-drop objects and give you access to the right-click menu.

For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface (e.g., mouse pad or desk) in front of your computer. The picture is an example of a Logitech desktop computer mouse with two primary buttons and a wheel.

        <p class="para">Who invented the mouse?
            The mouse was initially known as the X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System and was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1963 while working at Xerox PARC. But, due to Alto's lack of success, the first widely used application of the mouse was with the Apple Lisa computer. Today, this pointing device is on virtually every computer.</p><br>




            <h1>What are the uses of a mouse?</h1><br>

<p class="para">Below is a list of all the computer mouse functions and options to give you an idea of all the mouse capabilities.<br>
1) Move the mouse cursor - The primary function is to move the mouse pointer on the screen.<br>
2) Point - Once the mouse is moved, you can point something out for another user or point a digital object.
For example, in a game you can use the mouse to point a gun in the direction to shoot.<br>
3) Open or execute a program - Once you've moved the pointer to an icon, folder, or another object clicking or double-clicking that object 
    opens the document or executes the program. Some programs even support tripple-clicking.<br>
4) Select - A mouse also lets you select text or a file or highlight and select multiple files at once.<br>
5) Drag-and-drop - Once something is selected, it can also be moved using the drag-and-drop method.<br>
6) Hover - Moving the mouse cursor over objects with hover information helps discover each object's function.<br>
7) Scroll - When working with a long document or viewing a long web page, you may need to scroll up or down.To scroll, rotate the mouse wheel, or click-and-drag the scroll bar.<br>
            The mouse wheel can also be used as a button. See the IntelliMouse page for further information and functions of the mouse wheel.
8) Perform other functions - Many desktop mice also have buttons that can be programmed to perform any function.</p><br>
